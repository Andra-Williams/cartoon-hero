            <h2>About Naruto</h2>
            <p>Naruto is, of course, the main character of the anime
                “Naruto”. He is a  ninja who’s goal is to become the
                “Kage” or Chief of his hometown, The village hidden
                in the leaves. Naruto is very different compared to
                other  kid ninjas in his hometown. He doesn’t have
                any special bloodline powers like some other kids
                do, but when he was born he was cursed with the
                power of the nine-tailed demon fox sealed inside
                of his body.</p>
