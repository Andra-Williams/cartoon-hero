            <h2>About Coffee</h2>
            <p>Coffee trees are pruned short to conserve their energy and aid in harvesting,
             but can grow to more than 30 feet (9 meters) high. Each tree is covered with
              green, waxy leaves growing opposite each other in pairs. Coffee cherries grow
               along the branches. Because it grows in a continuous cycle, itâ€™s not unusual
                to see flowers, green fruit and ripe fruit simultaneously on a single tree.
It takes nearly a year for a cherry to mature after first flowering, and about 5 years of growth
 to reach full fruit production. While coffee plants can live up to 100 years, they are generally
  the most productive between the ages of 7 and 20. Proper care can maintain and even increase their
   output over the years, depending on the variety. The average coffee tree produces 10 pounds of coffee cherry per year,
    or 2 pounds of green beans.
All commercially grown coffee is from a region of the world called the Coffee Belt. The trees grow best in rich soil,
 with mild temperatures, frequent rain and shaded sun.</p>
